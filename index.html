            Hi, my name is Wisdom Ikechi. I’m from Abuja, Nigeria. My hobbies include robotics, exploring hidden
            documentaries, and playing tennis. I’m currently studying Software Engineering through
            BYU Pathway, and I’m especially excited to dive deeper into web development and design.
            I look forward to building my own website soon and continuing to explore the
            world of code with curiosity and passion for innovation.

            Abuja is Nigeria's administrative and political capital.
            As the seat of the Federal Government of Nigeria, it hosts key national institutions, landmarks, and
            buildings spread
            across its over 50 districts. It replaced Lagos (the most populous city in Nigeria) as the capital on 12
            December 1991.
